The consumers behaviors are likely to be changed permanently. It's important to have an online store for every business.

As the world faces this covid 19 pandemic, clothing stores are studying how the pandemic situation is giving impact to fashion industry. Retailers are shutting down their physical store all over the world, which motivating people to buy clothes online instead because people are forced to stay at home for long time.

## Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your app
The app developed on Rails based on MVC pattern. MVC divides the work of Vintage Fashion into models, views and controller. Models work behind the scenes at high level, views face to buyer and sellers, and controller is responsoble for accepting input and converting inout to commands for models and views.

Take controller for home.page as an example. Firstly I generate a new controller named pages. Then Ithe app has pages_controller.rb and a folder named pages under view folder. Then in route.rb, I defined root route. 
![root route](/docs/rootroute.png)

Next this app need methods in controller since controller is about implementation. I defined a method named index. 
![page controller](/docs/pagecontroller.png)

The app will pass the view, so a template for interactive request will be created, which is under pages folder, and the document is home.html.erb. The app pass this html.erb doc as view to user. The methods in controller can also access to model, it give the view access to the model. Model mantain relationship between database and objects. A class called ActiveRecord is inherited from by each of the app's models.

MVC model make the app easy to maintenance and improved the ability for the app to grow. It also provide reusability, like a model can be reused by many views.


## Detail any third party services that your app will use
* Heroku: Heroku is a cloud Platform as a Service. This app is being deployed on Heroku and it is deployeding with Git, which means the app has been pushed on Github and the app on git hub repository is associating with Heroku. Documents in app like the static images are complied, stored and deployed throught Asset Pipeline.
* Stripe: Stripe is also a gem. Stripe API allows this app to acess the functionality of Stripe. The "buy" button on the page showing a certain product of this app link to the Stripe payment service. Customer can fill out their payment information on that page and the transcation they made will show on the dashboard of a Stripe testing account. 
* Ultrahook: The app also utilise webhook, a HTTP push API, to let Stripe make http request to app when buyer see a successful check out. Ultrahook is a simple too that connect endpoints. This is a way for stripe to send HTTP request to Vintage Fashion because Stripe can listen for the internal event and when the event happens, Stripe send a HTTP request. This 

## Describe your projects models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other



## Discuss the database relations to be implemented in your application
Users and categories and listings have id bigint data types, because primary key must be unque and never repeats. Categories has many listings and category id is a foreign key in listings table, another foreign key for listing table is user id. They depend on each other. Databases use active record assosciations to create reationships between the different models. 

## An ERD for your app
![erd](/docs/ERD.png)

## Provide your database schema design

## Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project
Trello was used to allocated and tracked tasks. Trello hass Lists and Cards for organise tasks in a flexible way.

The lists for tasks are as follows:

* To do: This list include tasks I will work in future.
* In progress: This list include tasks I am working on.
* Bugs: This list include blockers need to be fixed and possible errors need to be fixed or improved 
* Review: This list include tasks to be test or check or redo many times(like git commit)
* Done: Completed tasks cards will be moved to this list.

The label for all the cards are as follows:
* Code: Tasks relating to coding aspects of the app. 
* Design: Includes ERD and wireframe and UI UX design.
* Deployment: The taks relating to deployment to Heroku.
* Git: Tasks relating to version control.
* Other: Oher task like documentations and etc.

I find it's easier to set lists as working progress and card labels as work type rather than the other way around. Because it's easier to notice how much tasks left for you to manage your time to finish all of them. Workload can be estimated by how long a certain list is.
